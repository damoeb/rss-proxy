# RSS-proxy 

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/damoeb/rss-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/damoeb/rss-proxy)

RSS-proxy allows you to do create an ATOM or JSON feed of any static website or feeds (web to feed), 
just by analyzing just the HTML structure. It is an alternative UI to [feedless](https://github.com/damoeb/feedless) with a reduced feature set.
If you want advanced features like fulltext feeds, aggregation, persistence, authentication and others, checkout [feedless](https://github.com/damoeb/feedless/blob/master/docs/third-party-migration.md)
